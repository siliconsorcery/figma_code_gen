# Figma Code Flutter

`Figma Code Flutter` is an experiment in flutter code generation that uses a Figma design document as the source and creates Dart source code that implements a Flutter version of the design.

### Figma Plugin Development - Setup Guide

Sourced from [Figma Plugin Guide](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/setup/)

This short guide will walk you through the steps needed to setup your development environment for writing and running a simple plugin inside of Figma. By the end of this guide, you will have a plugin that opens a modal, asks the user for a number, and creates that many rectangles on the canvas.

These instructions intend for you to develop plugins in TypeScript using Visual Studio Code. Neither are mandatory: you can develop plugins in any text editor and use any language which can be translated to JavaScript (including JavaScript itself!). But we find that TypeScript and Visual Studio Code provide the best editing experience. We provide a [type definition file](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/typings/) to make this experience even better.

### [](#install-visual-studio-code)Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code can be downloaded here: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

This lets you use TypeScript, which we think makes developing good plugins much easier.

### [](#install-nodejs-and-npm)Install Node.js and NPM

You can download Node.js here, which will include NPM: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### [](#install-typescript)Install TypeScript

To install TypeScript, run `sudo npm install -g typescript` in a terminal. (This isn't installed by Visual Studio Code).

### [](#get-the-figma-desktop-app)Get the Figma desktop app

At this time, plugin development and testing needs to be done using the Figma desktop app. This is because Figma needs to read your code saved as a local file. The Figma desktop app can be downloaded here: [https://www.figma.com/downloads/](https://www.figma.com/downloads/).

If you already have the desktop app, please make sure to update to the latest version, as several features have been added specifically in order to provide a better plugin development experience.

### [](#log-in-to-your-account-and-open-the-file-editor-in-the-figma-desktop-app)Log in to your account and open the file editor in the Figma desktop app

You can open any existing document or create a new one.

### Go to Menu > Plugins > Development > New Plugin...

This will bring up the "Create a plugin" modal to create a sample plugin. Give it a name, then choose "With UI & browser APIs" in the next screen. Save the plugin anywhere on disk.

### Open the code folder

Open the folder you just created using Visual Studio Code. Plugins are defined using multiple files and you'll want to be able to edit them all of them, so one trick is to open the folder itself rather than any of the files inside it.

### Install the typings

Run `npm install --save-dev @figma/plugin-typings`.

### Set up TypeScript compilation

Hit âŒ˜â‡§B (Ctrl-Shift-B for Windows) in Visual Studio Code, then select `tsc: watch - tsconfig.json`. This tells Visual Studio Code to compile `code.ts` into `code.js`. It will watch for changes to `code.ts` and automatically re-generate `code.js` every time `code.ts` is saved.

### Run the sample plugin

Create a new design file in the Figma editor. Go to Menu > Plugins > Development > YourPluginName to run your newly created plugin. The sample code will show a UI allowing you to choose a number, and then creates that many rectangles.

### Make some test changes

Make some simple changes to `code.ts` to get familiar with Visual Studio Code and the Figma Plugin API (**not** code.**js** â€” that's generated and gets overwritten!).

### Run your new code

Switch back to the Figma Desktop App and go to Menu > Plugins > "Run Last Plugin" (Or hit âŒ¥âŒ˜P for Mac or Ctrl+Alt+P for Windows). This will rerun the last plugin that you ran, i.e. your plugin.

Thatâ€™s it! You are now ready to develop plugins in Figma!

## Changelog

### 0.1.0 - 18 March 2021

* Initial Open Source release.
* Figma plugin
  * Walks node hierarchy and logs results to the development console. The walk is based on a frame named "Flutter", selection or document root node.
  * Dumps stats to the development console.
